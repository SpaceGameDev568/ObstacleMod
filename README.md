This is a mod for Satisfactory that adds some obstacles inspired by Fall Guys to mess around with. The source code here is free to use for your own projects, though I'd prefer if you didn't just redistribute the mod, and please credit me if you re-use the models.

Jetbrains has provided me a free copy of their software for developing my mods, so huge thanks to them! You can check out their software here: https://www.jetbrains.com, or get a free copy for your open-source projects here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource
